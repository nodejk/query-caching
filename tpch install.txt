Loading TPC-H data into postgres

1. To load the ddl file

> psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -1 -h localhost -U postgres -f [file] [db_name]

2. Remove trailing delimiter from the .tbl files

> for i in `ls *.tbl`; do sed 's/|$//' $i > ${i/tbl/csv}; done

3. Copy csv files into postgres (in psql)

> \copy customer from 'C:/Users/.../...' with CSV DELIMITER '|';

Note: Make sure to use normal slashes for file name, even for windows
